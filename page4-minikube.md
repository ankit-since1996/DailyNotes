# Page4: Minikube

**Minikube:**

A tool that makes it easy to run a l**ocal, single-node, complete Kubernetes cluster** on your machine

**Single Node Cluster**, ie, only has a master node, and we deploy our workload/application pods in that master node. Unlike kubeadmn, where the master node is tainted and we need to have separate worker nodes for the workload, here the **master node is untainted.**
